## Welcome to BTC-Fundamentals

This page is intended to analyse the fundamentals of Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) and also make a connection between BTC and gold, since many investors prefer to have gold in their portfolios to hedge against volatility. This argument has proven correct during many different crisis such as the dot-com and also the 2008 financial crisis. However, this scenario has changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, where investors chose to have part of their savings into Cryptocurries like BTC or ETH even though these coins are extremely volatile.

Although Cryptocurrencies are very volatile for the short-term, they are still considered a good investment to have in a long-term portfolio and this coin could replace the cash component, since BTC has shown a great potential to hedge against inflation as well.
